## Layers

In this module I selected the following neuron setup : 
  * Hidden Layer 1 = 50 neurons
  * Hidden Layer 2 = 25 neurons
  * Hidden Layer 3 = 12 neurons
  * Hidden Layer 4 - 4 neurons
  
 ## Accuracy Rate 
 Through many attempts of filtering and added data back in and out , adjusting the epochs, batch sizes , activation types etc I was able to achieve 70% accuracy level. 
 
 ## Different Model 
 With the all the different machine learning models I think the only way to find the best fit is through trial and error.
